# 👋 Hello👋

### 🔮 I research NLP, the innovation, future and beneficence of models and datasets🔮
I hope to find novel ways to expand upon the capabilities of existing models, increase interpretibility and help to develop better datasets designed for both effectiveness and ethics by design. 

### 🔮 Can also be a full stack software builder, with many diverse experience 🔮
With proficiency across many programming languages I hope to use and expand my skills in app development, from backend and database system design to front end and UX design and implementation. While I don't hang up on languages or frameworks and view these as evolving systems in themselves, I find React, Vue and Next Javascript frameworks the most efficient for modern web app development.
